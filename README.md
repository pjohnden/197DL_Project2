## Project 2 - Zero shot Key Word Spotting (KWS) using ImageBind
`ImageBind` is a large multimodal model which learns a joint embedding across six different modalities - images, text, audio, depth, thermal, and IMU data. 
It enables novel emergent applications ‘out-of-the-box’ including cross-modal retrieval, composing modalities with arithmetic, cross-modal detection and generation. 

`KWS`, using the `speech commands v2` dataset, is made of 37-category single word utterances like "Yes", "No", "Left", "Right", etc (including silence and unknown) 
and can be downloaded from torchaudio datasets.
